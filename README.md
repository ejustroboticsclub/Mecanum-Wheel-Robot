# Project Name: Mecanum-Wheel-Robot

The mecanum wheel robot is a four-wheeled robot that can move in any direction using four mecanum wheels. The robot is controlled using an accelerometer sensor that is attached to a controlling arm. When the controlling arm is moved, the accelerometer sensor measures the inclination of the arm and sends this data to the microcontroller via a Bluetooth module. The microcontroller then processes the data and determines the direction and speed of the mecanum wheels based on the inclination of the controlling arm.

## Prerequisites
“The required skill for a participant to be a part of the team working on this project. Must be clear as possible in bullet points as shown in the example”
*	Electric and electronic circuits (intermediate).
*	Arduino programming (Basic).
*	Mechanical knowledge (Basic).

##	Learning Outcomes
“The skills and knowledge acquired by a participant after completing the project. Must be clear as possible in bullet points as shown in the example”
*	Understanding of mecanum wheel robot kinematics: Working with a mecanum wheel robot involves understanding the unique kinematics of the wheels, which allows for omnidirectional movement. By working on a mecanum wheel robot, the learner can gain a deeper understanding of how these wheels work and how they can be used to achieve different types of movement.

*	Experience with microcontroller programming: To control the mecanum wheel robot using an accelerometer sensor and Bluetooth module, the learner would need to program a microcontroller to receive sensor data, interpret it, and control the robot's movements. This can provide valuable experience with microcontroller programming and embedded systems.

*	Experience with wireless communication: Using a Bluetooth module to communicate between the two microcontroller requires a solid understanding of wireless communication protocols. Working with a mecanum wheel robot that uses Bluetooth communication can provide valuable experience in designing, testing, and troubleshooting wireless communication systems.
